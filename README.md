# Overview
This app is a basic todo list that is built using kotlin. A uder can add a todo item into the list from an input box, 
then they can check tasks off as they are completed. Finally, there is a button that can be pressed to delete all of
the completed tasks.

I created this app to learn how to use Kotlin for android development. I used a tutorial that walked me through 
the process. This really helped me to gain some experience in the language and introduced a lot of new ideas.
